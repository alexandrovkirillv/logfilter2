-f, --follow 		            Follow log data. This option causes filter
         			            to not stop when end of file is reached, but wait
 		        	            for additional data to be appended to the input.
 			                    It is done if the data input is closed (i.e. file
 			                    became unreadable or stadard input reaches the
 			                    end). It also can be interrupted after the SIGINT
                                signal is received.

 -o, --out <FILE>               Determine a target output destination. This option
 			                    overrides the standard output which is used by default.

 -s, --start <DATETIME>         Filter out the log lines that are reported before
                                the given time point. The UTC <DATETIME> has
                                "YY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ" format.

 -e, --end <DATETIME>           Filter out the log lines that are reported after
                                the given time point. The UTC <DATETIME> has
                                "YY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ" format.

 -p, --period <DURATION>        Calculate time boundary using a relative time
                                which is used in combination with --start or
                                --end options. The <DURATION> follows an ISO-8601
                                time duration format. It is wrong to use this
                                option with --start and --end simultaneously
                                as well as without anyone of both. If a period
                                is used with a start datetime then an end datetime
                                equals the start plus the period. On the other
                                side, using a period with an end datetime means
                                start datetime equals the end minus the period.

 -l, --level <LEVEL>...         Filter the log records by their levels. It is
                                possible to pass multiple levels using a comma-
                                separated list of levels.

 -t, --thread <MASK>            Filter out the log lines which are not matched
                                with the <MASK>, where the <MASK> is a string
                                optionally containing wildcards (* matches zero
                                or more characters, ? matches exactly one
                                character).

 -m, --message <MASK>           Filter out the log lines which are not matched
                                against the <MASK>, where the <MASK> is a string
                                optionally containing wildcards (* matches zero
                                or more characters, ? matches exactly one
                                character).

 --strict                       Terminate processing after the first improper
                                log line. By default, a wrong line is skipped
                                silently.

 -c, --stats                    Print out collected statistics of filtered data
                                instead of data themselves. This option enables
                                filter-and-collect mode. If this option is used
                                with -f option then statistics will be printed
                                after the following accomplishes.
